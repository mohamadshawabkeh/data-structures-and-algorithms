# Stack and Queue Implementation

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of a Stack and a Queue data structure using a linked list as the underlying data storage mechanism. The Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while the Queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

## Stack

The Stack class has the following methods:

- `push(value)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the value from the top of the stack.
- `peek()`: Returns the value of the node at the top of the stack without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

## Queue

The Queue class has the following methods:

- `enqueue(value)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the back of the queue.
- `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the value from the front of the queue.
- `peek()`: Returns the value of the node at the front of the queue without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the queue is empty.

## Tests

- npm test stack-queue
