# Binary Search

This is a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in JavaScript.

## Algorithm Description

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or determined to be not present in the array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the search space in each iteration.

## Usage

The `binarysearch` function takes in two parameters: an array (`arr`) and a value (`value`). It returns the index of the value in the array if found, or -1 if the value is not present.
